                    <a href="https://wetpourrepair.co.uk/types-of-wetpour-repair/">Different types of damage</a>, such as cracks, tears, or discolouration, require specific repair techniques, impacting the overall repair process and costs accordingly.
                </p>
                <h3>Size of the Damaged Area</h3>
                <p>
                    The size of the damaged area plays a significant role in determining the overall cost of wetpour repair. <b>Larger damaged areas</b> may require more materials and labour to restore, leading to higher repair costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Larger damaged areas can pose greater challenges during the repair process. Ensuring a seamless blend between the new and existing wetpour surfaces becomes more intricate as the damaged area expands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thorough assessment is crucial to accurately gauge the extent of the damage and plan the repair strategy accordingly. In some cases, extensive damage may necessitate specialised equipment or techniques to ensure a durable and visually appealing result.
                </p>
                <h3>Depth of the Damage</h3>
                <p>
                    The depth of the damage, especially in <b>EPDM rubber surfacing</b>, can impact the cost of wetpour repair. Deeper damage may require extensive repairs or even replacement of the affected area, resulting in higher repair costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When <b>EPDM rubber surfacing</b> incurs deep damage, the repair process becomes more complex and labour-intensive.
                </p>

                    Minor wetpour repairs, <b>focusing on small patches of damage</b>, can be completed with precision and quality workmanship. These repairs are generally more cost-effective and targeted, ensuring the longevity of the wetpour surface.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <h3>Moderate Repairs (Large Patches or Small Areas)</h3>
                <p>
                    Moderate wetpour repairs involving large patches or small areas often require the use of cutting-edge equipment and specialised techniques to ensure effective restoration. These repairs may fall within a mid-range cost category, balancing quality and affordability.

                </p>
                <h3>Major Repairs (Large Areas or Full Replacement)</h3>
                <p>

These repairs involve significant expenses due to the scale and complexity of the restoration process.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    In cases where the damage is extensive or the surface has reached the end of its lifespan, opting for a full replacement becomes necessary. This process involves removing the old surface entirely and installing a new wetpour layer, ensuring a fresh, durable surface that meets safety standards.
                </p>
